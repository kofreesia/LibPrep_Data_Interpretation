Data preparation_From DNA extraction to library construction for NGS.

I am in charge of extracting genomic DNA from several fish species and constructing NGS (next-generation sequencing) libraries by using a commercial kit.

To save money and time, I have come up with a half-protocol that allows us to use only half the volume of all the reagents to reach the goal as promised by the kit.

Here, I submit all the records and analysis procedures showing the performance of the half-protocol.
